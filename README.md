## Steps to run the viewer from scratch

Get the code:
git clone https://github.com/sohail49/dcw-file-upload

Install dependencies (using `yarn`, replace with `npm` if you prefer):
npm install
yarn install

Call the start script to launch the viewer on a local server:
npm start
yarn run start

You can now open a browser at http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!
